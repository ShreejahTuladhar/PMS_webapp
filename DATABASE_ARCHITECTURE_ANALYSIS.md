# 🗄️ ParkSathi Database Architecture & Query Logic Design

## 📊 **CURRENT DATABASE STRUCTURE**

### Core Models:
1. **User** - User management and authentication
2. **ParkingLocation** - Parking spots and location data  
3. **Booking** - Reservation and transaction records
4. **Violation** - Parking violation tracking

## 🔍 **STEP 1: DATABASE SCHEMA ANALYSIS**

### Current Collections Structure:
```
📦 parking_management (Database)
├── 👥 users (User accounts, auth, profiles)
├── 🅿️ locations (Parking locations, spaces, rates)
├── 📅 bookings (Reservations, payments, history)
├── 🚨 violations (Parking violations, fines)
├── 📝 auditlogs (System audit trail)
└── 📍 parkinglocations (Legacy/duplicate?)
```

### Current Data Volume:
- **Users**: 8 records
- **Locations**: 224 parking locations
- **Bookings**: 9 active bookings
- **Total Objects**: 241 across all collections
- **Data Size**: 0.45 MB
- **Storage Size**: 0.29 MB

## 🏗️ **STEP 3: ADVANCED DATABASE DESIGN STRATEGY**

### Query Optimization Priorities:
1. **Performance** - Sub-second response times
2. **Scalability** - Handle 10K+ concurrent users
3. **Analytics** - Complex aggregation support
4. **Real-time** - Live dashboard updates
5. **Reporting** - Business intelligence queries

### Index Strategy:
1. **Compound Indexes** for multi-field queries
2. **Partial Indexes** for conditional queries
3. **Text Indexes** for search functionality
4. **Geospatial Indexes** for location queries
5. **TTL Indexes** for data lifecycle management

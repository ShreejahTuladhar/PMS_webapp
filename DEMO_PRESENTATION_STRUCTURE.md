## ðŸŽ¤ 7-8 Minute Talking Script

### **Opening (0:00-0:30)**
"Namaste! Welcome to ParkSathi - your friendly neighborhood parking solution built right here in Nepal. Today I'm excited to show you how we're making parking simple, affordable, and stress-free for everyone in Kathmandu Valley. Let's take a journey through our platform and see how we're solving Nepal's parking challenges."

### **Home Page Demo (0:30-2:00)**
"Let's start with our homepage - the heart of ParkSathi. Notice our warm, welcoming design - this isn't just another app, it's built by Nepali neighbors for Nepali neighbors.

Watch as I demonstrate our **smart search functionality**. I'll type 'Thamel' - one of Kathmandu's busiest areas. See how instantly our system finds nearby parking spots? This is our **real-time discovery engine** at work.

Look at this beautiful **interactive map view** - each pin represents an available parking spot with live availability data. And here's our **premium location banner** highlighting the best spots with special offers.

The **list view** shows detailed information - hourly rates, available spaces, amenities, and distance. Everything a driver needs to make the right choice. Notice how we display prices in Nepali Rupees with fair, transparent pricing - no hidden fees, just honest rates."

### **About Page (2:00-3:00)**
"Now let's visit our About page to understand ParkSathi's mission. 

We're proudly **'Made by Nepalis for Nepalis'** - this isn't a foreign solution adapted for Nepal, it's built from the ground up understanding our unique challenges - narrow streets, limited parking, and the need for affordable solutions.

See these six core benefits: **Find Nearby Spots, Easy Booking, Live Updates, Fair Payment, Local Suggestions, and Safe & Secure parking**. Each addresses real problems our users face daily.

Here's our simple **4-step process**: Find Spot â†’ Pick & Book â†’ Pay Easy â†’ Park Happy. We believe parking shouldn't be complicated - these four steps are all you need."

### **Park Now Page - Customer Journey (3:00-6:00)**
"This is where the magic happens - our **customer journey page**. This is the 'Park Now' experience that takes you from arrival to departure.

**Step 1 - Welcome**: Users get a warm greeting with clear expectations - park in under 30 seconds, everything digital, smart and simple.

**Step 2 - Vehicle Registration**: Look at this clean interface for registering vehicles. Users can add multiple vehicles - cars, motorcycles, bicycles. Our system automatically calculates pricing based on vehicle type.

**Step 3 - Entry & Digital Ticket**: This is revolutionary - instead of paper tickets, users get a **digital QR code ticket** on their phone. No more lost tickets, no more manual processes. The QR code contains all parking information - entry time, location, vehicle details.

**Step 4 - Parked Status**: Users see their **live parking status** - how long they've been parked, current charges, and can easily extend time if needed. There's also instant access to customer support.

**Step 5 - Exit Process**: When ready to leave, our **payment verification system** calculates exact charges and processes payment through multiple options - eSewa, Khalti, cash, or card.

Notice the **progress indicator** at the top - users always know where they are in the journey. And see this **floating support button** - help is always one tap away."

### **Dashboard Page (6:00-8:00)**
"Finally, let's explore our **comprehensive user dashboard** - the command center for all parking activities.

Look at these **smart statistics cards**: Total bookings, total spent, amount saved, and upcoming bookings. Users can track their parking habits and savings over time.

The **booking manager** shows complete history with status indicators - confirmed, completed, cancelled. Users can view **digital tickets** for active bookings right from this dashboard.

Here's our **payment portal** with complete transaction history - every payment is tracked and receipts are always available.

**Vehicle management** lets users maintain multiple vehicles and set default preferences. 

**Favorite locations** saves frequently used parking spots for quick booking.

These **smart quick actions** provide one-click access to common tasks - view current ticket, find parking, contact support, or manage vehicles.

The beauty is in the integration - search, book, navigate, and pay all work seamlessly together."

### **Closing (8:00-8:30)**
"This is ParkSathi - more than just a parking app, it's a community solution that connects neighbors with neighbors, making parking fair, accessible, and stress-free for everyone.

We've built this with love for our beautiful valley, understanding that every rupee matters, every minute saved counts, and every parking spot found makes someone's day a little bit better.

Thank you for joining me on this journey through ParkSathi - where parking meets friendship, and technology serves our community. Dhanyabad!"

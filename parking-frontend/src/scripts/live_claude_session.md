**Time**: 2025-08-11T16:56:54.339Z

#### 📋 The Problem:
Swambhu/Swayambhunath location needs double checking and correction

#### 🔧 Claude's Solution Approach:
1. **Context Gathering**: Found Swayambhunath in search suggestions but missing coordinate definitions
2. **Problem Analysis**: Location existed in UI suggestion lists but had no coordinate support, causing search failures  
3. **Solution Design**: Add coordinates (27.7148, 85.2906) to all coordinate sources following consistency pattern
4. **Implementation**: Updated Home.jsx, SearchSection.jsx kathmanduAreas objects and generateSampleData.js location list
5. **Verification**: Generated new sample data and imported 3 Swayambhunath parking locations to database

#### 💡 Key Learning:
This demonstrates the importance of data consistency across frontend, backend, and database layers
